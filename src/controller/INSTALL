REQUIREMENTS
------------

Typical packages for Linux Ubuntu/Debian:

	ruby
	libopenssl-ruby
	libdbd-mysql-ruby
	libmysql-ruby
	libdbi-ruby1.8

A MySQL 5.0+ server.


INSTALLATION
------------

1 Install all dependencies (see REQUIREMENTS)

2 Edit 'lib/config.rb'

3 Create an user for Splay and grant it sufficient privileges in the MySQL database:

	$ mysql -u root -p
	(enter root passwd)
	create database splay;
	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON splay.* TO 'splay'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'splay' WITH GRANT OPTION;
	
	Warning: if the database is on a different host (host2) than the one on which the controller will run change the preceding line to:
		GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON splay.* TO 'splay'@'host2' IDENTIFIED BY 'splay' WITH GRANT OPTION;
	or
		GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON splay.* TO 'splay'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'splay' WITH GRANT OPTION;
	if the host onto which the controller will run has no fixed hostname (or if you intend to move the controller to a different host in the future).

4 Edit/Create 'lib/db_config.rb', set your mysql access, like that:

	class DBConfig
		SQL_TYPE = "Mysql"
		SQL_DB = "splay"
		SQL_HOST = "localhost"
		SQL_USER = "splay"
		SQL_PASS = "splay"
	end

5 Initialize DB:
	./init_db.rb

6 Run the application:
	./controller_fork.rb

	To achieve major scalability, multiple instances of splayd and logd (see
	NumSplayd and NumLogd in config.rb). Each instance is able to control up to
	100 client splayd. When running your client splayd, you need to dispatch them
	to connect on a port of the range [SplaydPort - (SplaydPort + NumSplayd - 1)].


MySQL Ruby DBI Bug
------------------

MySQL DBI has a bug on certain systems, if you get this error:

/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/DBD/Mysql/Mysql.rb:649:in `column_info': undefined method `[]' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)
        from /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/DBD/Mysql/Mysql.rb:648:in `each'
        from /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/DBD/Mysql/Mysql.rb:648:in `column_info'
        from /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/DBD/Mysql/Mysql.rb:573:in `execute'
        from /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/thread.rb:135:in `synchronize'


apply this patch on the file (Mysql.rb):

593c593
<                       type_symbol = Database::TYPE_MAP[type][1] || :as_str
---
>                       type_symbol = Database::TYPE_MAP.key?(type) ? Database::TYPE_MAP[type][1] : :as_str
649c649
<                       mysql_type_name = Database::TYPE_MAP[col.type][0]
---
>                       mysql_type_name = Database::TYPE_MAP.key?(col.type) ? Database::TYPE_MAP[col.type][0] : 'UNKNOWN'
