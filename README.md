This is the official github repository of the Splay project.

Overview
===

SPLAY simplifies the prototyping and development of large-scale distributed applications and overlay networks. SPLAY covers the complete chain of distributed system design, development and testing: from coding and local runs to controlled deployment, experiment control and monitoring.
SPLAY allows developers to specify their distributed applications in a concise way using a specialized language based on Lua, a highly-efficient embeddable scripting language. SPLAY applications execute in a safe environment with restricted access to local resources (file system, network, memory) and can be instantiated on a large variety of testbeds composed a large set of nodes with a single command.
SPLAY is the outcome of research and development activities at the [Computer Science Department](http://www2.unine.ch/iiun) of the University of Neuchatel.
